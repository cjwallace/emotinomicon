# THE EMOTINOMICON

THE EMOTINOMICON is an app for internal navigation.

You can play with it [here](https://standard.dev/emotinomicon).

This README, like the app, is a work in progress.

### TODO:

- if no matching selection, display a message rather than fully close popup
- automated test aria (playwright has some integrations)
- actually test aria (use a screenreader, eg)
